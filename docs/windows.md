# Notes for Windows Users

ng-log defines the severity level `ERROR`, which is also defined by `windows.h`.
You can make nglog not define `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` by
defining `NGLOG_NO_ABBREVIATED_SEVERITIES` before including `nglog/logging.h`.
Even with this macro, you can still use the iostream like logging facilities:

``` cpp
#define NGLOG_NO_ABBREVIATED_SEVERITIES
#include <windows.h>
#include <ng-log/logging.h>

// ...

LOG(ERROR) << "This should work";
LOG_IF(ERROR, x > y) << "This should be also OK";
```

However, you cannot use `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` anymore for
functions defined in `nglog/logging.h`.

``` cpp
#define NGLOG_NO_ABBREVIATED_SEVERITIES
#include <windows.h>
#include <ng-log/logging.h>

// ...

// This wonâ€™t work.
// nglog::FlushLogFiles(nglog::ERROR);

// Use this instead.
nglog::FlushLogFiles(nglog::NGLOG_ERROR);
```

If you don't need `ERROR` defined by `windows.h`, there are a couple of more
workarounds which sometimes don't work[^1]:

-  `#!cpp #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` or `NOGDI` **before**
   `#!cpp #include <windows.h>`.
-  `#!cpp #undef ERROR` **after** `#!cpp #include <windows.h>`.
